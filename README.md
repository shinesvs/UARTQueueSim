## UARTQueueSim

This is a simple project that simulates a **UART receive buffer** using a **singly linked list** in C. In embedded systems, data received over UART often gets stored byte-by-byte into a queue â€” this project mimics that behavior in software.

It supports:

* Enqueuing characters as they "arrive"
* Dequeuing characters for processing
* Checking if the buffer is empty
* Printing the current state of the buffer

Itâ€™s a fun way to practice **linked lists**, **pointers**, and **basic embedded-style logic** â€” all without needing actual UART hardware.

### ðŸ’¡ Why I built this

To get more hands-on with how UART queues are managed at a low level and to sharpen my skills in memory handling, linked lists, and real-time data processing patterns.
